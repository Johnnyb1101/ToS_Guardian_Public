# TOS Guardian

A Chrome browser extension that intercepts "I Agree" buttons and analyzes Terms of Service and Privacy Policy documents with AI — so you know what you're agreeing to before you agree.

## What It Does

Most people click "I Agree" without reading anything. TOS Guardian stops that. When you click an agree button on any website, the extension intercepts it, fetches the actual legal documents, analyzes them with AI, and returns a plain-English summary covering:

- 🔴 Data selling and sharing — who gets your data and why
- 🔴 Opt-out rights — what you can actually do about it
- 📋 How to opt out right now — specific steps, links, and setting paths
- 🟡 Auto-renewal and billing traps
- 🟢 Data deletion rights — how to get your data removed

## How It Works

TOS Guardian runs a multi-agent pipeline entirely inside the Chrome extension:

Memory → Fetcher → Link Follower → Analyzer → Evaluator → UI

- **Memory Agent** — caches analysis results locally for 15 days and in a community Supabase database. Uses semantic similarity via pgvector to detect meaningful ToS changes rather than exact text matching
- **Fetcher Agent** — retrieves legal documents via a server-side proxy to bypass CORS restrictions. Supports Next.js `__NEXT_DATA__` extraction for JS-rendered pages, with hidden tab rendering as fallback
- **Link Follower Agent** — hunts down opt-out and privacy settings pages buried inside documents, follows them, and appends their content before analysis
- **Analyzer** — sends combined documents to an AI model with a structured 5-category prompt
- **Evaluator Agent** — scores the analysis quality before it reaches you
- **Site Database** — 30+ hardcoded known sites for instant URL lookup, plus self-learning for new sites
- **Proxy Server** — a Node.js/Express server on Railway handles server-side document fetching and community cache reads/writes via Supabase

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`
3. Enable **Developer mode** (top right toggle)
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the project folder
5. Right-click the TOS Guardian icon → **Options**
6. Enter your API key and select your AI provider
7. Visit any site with an agree button and click it

> **Note:** TOS Guardian requires your own API key to function.
> See Supported AI Providers below for where to get one.
> Anthropic offers free trial credits to new accounts.

## Supported AI Providers

TOS Guardian supports three AI providers. You supply your own API key.

| Provider | Model | Get a key |
|---|---|---|
| Anthropic (Claude) | claude-haiku-4-5 | console.anthropic.com |
| OpenAI (GPT) | gpt-4o-mini | platform.openai.com |
| Ollama (Local) | llama3 | ollama.com |

## Browser Support

- ✅ Chrome
- ✅ Microsoft Edge — confirmed working
- 🔲 Firefox is not currently supported due to a service worker compatibility issue with Manifest V3

## Security

TOS Guardian was built with security as a first-class concern. The extension:

- Never stores API keys in code — keys live in `chrome.storage.local` only
- Routes all document fetching through a server-side proxy — no direct browser fetches to third-party legal pages
- Sanitizes all fetched document text before it reaches the AI prompt
- Defends against prompt injection via explicit system prompt instructions
- Validates all URLs before opening hidden tabs — blocks private IPs, localhost, and non-HTTPS
- Uses a WeakSet for button hook tracking — inaccessible to page scripts
- Verifies cached analysis integrity with a hash check on every read
- Evaluator schema validation — fails closed if analysis output doesn't match expected format

## Known Limitations

- Sites that submit forms via Enter key on an input field (not a button) may bypass interception
- Button interception on dynamically rendered Next.js pages may require a second click in some cases when browser DevTools is open
- The self-learning site database writes to both local storage and the community Supabase database — community entries expire after 15 days
- Reddit registration form submits via a cross-origin iframe — Enter key interception is not achievable at the extension layer. Button click interception works correctly on Reddit.

## Roadmap

- [x] Proxy server backend — server-side document fetching, CORS bypass
- [x] Community cache — Supabase-backed cross-user analysis sharing
- [x] Semantic similarity via pgvector for reliable ToS change detection
- [ ] Opt-out resource generation — forms, email templates, and direct links surfaced per site
- [ ] CCPA/GDPR deletion request generation and compliance tracking
- [ ] Chrome Web Store release

## About

I'm a healthcare professional with over a decade in the field and less than a year of coding experience. I started this project with no JavaScript knowledge, no CS background, and no idea what a service worker was.

What I did have was a reason. I got tired of watching people, including myself, get buried in loan calls and spam because some website buried a data-selling clause in a wall of legal text that nobody reads. That's the problem TOS Guardian exists to solve.

If you're a developer looking at this code and thinking "not bad for a first project", honestly, thank you. If you're a regular person who just wants to know what you're agreeing to, that's who this was built for.
